# Client_L (Series 5/5mx)
**Client_L** started life as *WardFive*, a medical patient manager for doctors in hospitals. I wrote it to help me keep track of all the patients under my care and the wards where I had responsibilities. It was **very useful**, and saved me a ton of time. When I released it initially as Shareware and then via **Palmaris Medical Ltd**, I found that lots of people were using it for very different purposes - I had a construction engineer using it to keep track of building projects; a minister was using it to organise his sermons (seriously); many people used it as a contact management tool or a database.

I'll be uploading the source code (OPL) here when I get around to it. Yes, I said I wouldn't be developing this, but I might make a few changes from time to time...

Anyway, you originally had to REGISTER the software - that seems silly in 2025. Here is your FREE CODE:
