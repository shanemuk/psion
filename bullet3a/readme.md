# Bullet3a - topic management for the Psion 3a
It's 2025, but the Psion Series 3a (c/mx) is still going strong! I am creating Bullet3a as a new app that makes use of your visual cortex to help you keep track of projects.
Bullet3a uses the SBAR (Situation / Background / Assessment / Recommendation) system to help organise your thoughts about your projects. 
This system is used by the military, large companies and organisations, government agencies and many others to rapidly and concisely get to the core of a problem.

Bullet3a is still very early in its gestation, and I don't have a huge amount of time to work on it, but it's here for your delectation, entertainment, and hopefully utility.
* [BULLET3A.OPL](https://github.com/shanemuk/psion/blob/main/bullet3a/BULLET3A.OPL) - OPL source code - have a look, play with it, see what you think. Put it in your Psion 3a's ```\OPL``` folder.
* [BULLET3A.OPA](https://github.com/shanemuk/psion/blob/main/bullet3a/BULLET3A.OPA) - the compiled OPA APP - put this in the ```\APP``` folder in your Psion 3a and install from the system screen: Psion-I
* [BULLET3A.BLJ](https://github.com/shanemuk/psion/blob/main/bullet3a/BULLET3A.BLJ) - an example file of a few bullet entries - put it in ```\BLJ``` and play around with it.

This is not finished software, and it is probably buggy. It contains a lot of old hangovers from the WARDRND.OPA app that I had written previously, so you'll see vestiges of this. The code is **OPEN SOURCE** with no limitations - have fun!

Enjoy!
