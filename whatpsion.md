# What is the best Psion for me?
Psion palmtops still come up pretty regularly on ebay, often for a pretty good price, if you keep your eyes open. This handy guide will help you decide on which is the right machine for you at this stage in your Psion journey.
## Netbook / Series 7
Pros: Big, colour screen, sub-laptop sized, so not quite as portable. Great keyboard. 
Cons: Internal rechargeable battery
Price: Up to £300 on ebay.
## Series 5mx
Pros: Very portable, capable, loads of apps. Uses CF cards, so you can exchange data with PC
Cons: Monochrome screen isn't great if you don't have good light.
Price: Up to £150 on ebay, but if you can wait around, you may get a really good one for sub-£100.
## Series 3mx
Price: up to £100
## Series 3a
Price: up to £40
## Series 3
Pros: cheap, keyboard every bit as good as 3a/c/mc
Cons: Small screen, limited memory, limited connectivity
Price: up to £25
## Final thoughts
These machines are from the 1990s, and it shows. They're not brilliant for anything internet related - I wouldn't use them for email or web browsing, for example. However, they are ideal for text editing, playing simple games, programming on the go, even keeping your schedule, so long as you don't need to sync it. Plus, they have amazing retro appeal, making you the coolest kid on the block. My workhorse is my 5mx. I do love my 3mx though.
