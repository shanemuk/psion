# Psion projects
Back in the day, Psion handheld computers were the business. We had a little company called **Palmaris Medical Ltd**, and we wrote medical software for these machines. The one I was most proud of was WardFive (also known as Client_L, which was a terrible name).

I have made all these files **OPEN SOURCE** - you are free to take, use, modify etc.

## Client_L (formerly WardFive; Series 5/5mx/7)
I wrote this for the Psion 5mx to help doctors manage their patient lists. It was (though I say so myself) _really handy_, and has stood the test of time. Like other Palmaris Medical Ltd software you had to purchase a registration code (sorry about that). **However**, as I'm not developing it any further (it's 2024 - let it go, Shane!), you can register for free. Here is the code: **gbh11fmpd4** and the user name is **Psion User**. Just type these in to the registration screen in Client_L and you should be good to go! If you're using the old WardFive, you can register with the code: DW@O]]REJ\

## WardRound (Series 3a/c/mx)
Before WardFive, there was WardRound for the Psion 3a. You can download it here: [WardRnd.zip](https://github.com/shanemuk/psion/blob/main/wardrnd.zip) You can use the code **[NWFTTI\AS** to register as **Psion User**. 
In the files section you will find WARDRND.OPL and WARDRND.PIC which are the source code and icon file respectively. You can use these to modify WardRound for your own needs.
