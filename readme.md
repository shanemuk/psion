# Psion projects
Back in the day, Psion handheld computers were the business. We had a little company called **Palmaris Medical Ltd**, and we wrote medical software for these machines. The one I was most proud of was WardFive (also known as Client_L, which was a terrible name).

Before WardFive, there was WardRound for the Psion 3a. You can download it here: [WardRnd.zip](https://github.com/shanemuk/psion/blob/main/wardrnd.zip)

If there's anything you particularly remember, please add as an Issue or post on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/shaneir.bsky.social)
