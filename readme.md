# Psion projects
Back in the day, Psion handheld computers were the business. We had a little company called **Palmaris Medical Ltd**, and we wrote medical software for these machines. The one I was most proud of was WardFive (also known as Client_L, which was a terrible name).

I have made all these files **OPEN SOURCE** - you are free to take, use, modify etc.

## Client_L (formerly WardFive; Series 5/5mx/7)
I wrote this for the Psion 5mx to help doctors manage their patient lists. It was (though I say so myself) _really handy_, and has stood the test of time. Like other Palmaris Medical Ltd software you had to purchase a registration code (sorry about that). **However**, as I'm not developing it any further (it's 2024 - let it go, Shane!), you can register for free. Here is the code: **gbh11fmpd4** and the user name is **Psion User**. Just type these in to the registration screen in Client_L and you should be good to go! If you're using the old WardFive, you can register with the code: DW@O]]REJ\

## WardRound (Series 3a/c/mx)
Before WardFive, there was WardRound for the Psion 3a. You can download it here: [WardRnd.zip](https://github.com/shanemuk/psion/blob/main/wardrnd.zip) You can use the code **[NWFTTI\AS** to register as **Psion User**. 
In the files section you will find WARDRND.OPL and WARDRND.PIC which are the source code and icon file respectively. You can use these to modify WardRound for your own needs.

## Watchmaker (Series 3a+)
The [Blind Watchmaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blind_Watchmaker) is a great book by Richard Dawkins, explaining how natural selection can work on genetic variation to evolve complex organisms. In the book he describes a computer program to generate "biomorphs" - very simple rules can be used to generate a shape, and then via mutations, you can select the next generation and so on, to produce interesting and complex "creatures". So I wrote a version for the Psion 3a. This is the [OPL file - you can download](https://github.com/shanemuk/psion/blob/main/WTCHMK2.OPL) it and translate it on your device. 

## Extras
The Psion Text Editor app (**Editor**) is a vital piece of software for editing text files on the device and the Emulator. I've included it here since it can be hard to find on-line. [Download Editor zip file](https://github.com/shanemuk/psion/blob/main/editor.zip).
