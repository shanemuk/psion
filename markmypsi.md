Look, it's 2025. We're not fooling anyone. A Psion Series 3a (or even 3mx or even 5mx) is unlikely to be your sole device for your digital activities. Let's be realistic. You have a phone. You have a PC. Your Psion is not going to *replace* any of these. The secret is to find a way - a workflow - whereby your Psion *adds to* your overall productivity as a component of the bigger system that is you and your life.

Many of the Psion apps are brilliant for what they do, but it's perhaps not realistic that they sync with every little thing. Also, many modern apps on PCs and phones are very fastidious about how they exchange data, and getting these to natively talk to each other is going to be hard.
Certain file types, like Word and Sheet, can be converted easily enough to their PC counterparts, but going the other direction is going to be pretty "lossy" in many cases, and a lot of the time we really just need a nice list of the information we're wanting to exchange, and where we want it to go. If that means occasionally adopting a semi-manual approach, is that such a bad thing? *Interacting* with our data is half the point, because the other component of that bigger system I was talking about is our *brain*.

So here is what I propose: use the Text application (which is an Alias of Word on EPOC16 - if you haven't installed that yet, DO IT!) as a continuous scribble file. Parse the file out with bespoke markdown headers to signal where the data needs to go. Then, when you're syncing with your PC, simply pull the file across and use that brain of yours to put the data where it needs to go. Simple!

Here is an example:
~~~
AGN: 15/7/2025 10am go to the shop; remember to get milk & bread & dog treats
DAT: Update Jimmy Bloggs' contact details; new phone number 07777 999999
OPL: Add routine to count the number of tabs at the start of each text line
~~~
Essentially, you're creating a to-do list, but specifically tagged to where you want the data to go. Now you save that TXT or WRD file, transfer it to your PC (if you wish), go through the items, *manually* syncing them with your work in progress, and syncing back to the Psion if you wish, and get on with your life as normal.

Question for the world: waste of time? Already doing something like this? Better ways of achieving the same objective? Disagree with my entire premise? Let me know! @shaneir.bsky.social on Bluesky.
